(a) Write brief notes about a tree representation of functional arrays, subscripted
by positive integers according to their representation in binary notation. How
efficient are the lookup and update operations? [6 marks]
(b) Write an ML function arrayoflist to convert the list [x1, . . . , xn] to the
corresponding functional array having xi at subscript position i for i = 1, . . . , n.
Your function should not call the update operation. [6 marks]
(c) Consider the task of finding out which elements of an array satisfy the predicate p,
returning the corresponding subscript positions as a list. For example, the list [2,3,6]
indicates that these three designated array elements, and no others, satisfy p.
Write an ML functional to do this for a given array and predicate, returning the
subscripts in increasing order. [8 marks]
All ML code must be explained clearly and should be free of needless complexity.
