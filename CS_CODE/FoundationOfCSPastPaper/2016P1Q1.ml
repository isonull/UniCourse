(a) Write brief notes on functions as values and results in ML, illustrated with the help of the functionals map and exists. What functions can we obtain from these via currying? [6 marks]
(b) Consider the function zarg defined below:
              fun zarg f ([], e) = e
              | zarg f (x::xs, e) = f(x, zarg f (xs,e));
Show that with the help of this function, it is possible to write an expression for the sum of a given list of integers. Then describe what zarg does in general.
[4 marks]
(c) A polymorphic type of branching trees can be declared as follows. Note that the children of a branch node are given as a list of trees, and that only the leaf nodes carry labels.
            datatype 'a vtree = Lf of 'a
                              | Br of ('a vtree) list;
(i) Write a function flat t that converts a given tree t of this type to a list of the labels (without eliminating duplicates). Your function should run in linear time in the size of the tree. [4 marks]
(ii) Write a function count x t that counts the number of times that x occurs as a label in t, but without first converting t to a list.
Note: Minimal credit will be given for solutions that use flat. [5 marks]
(iii) What is the type of count? [1 mark]
All ML code must be explained clearly and should be free of needless complexity.

fun zarg f ([], e) = e
  | zarg f (x::xs, e) = f(x, zarg f (xs,e));

fun addList ls = zarg (fn (x,y) => x + y) (ls,0);

(*
Generally zarg take a function f which takes 2 variables and apply it to a list [a1,a2,a3...an] to return
f(a1,f(a2,f(a3...(f(an,e))))).
